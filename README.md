How it started
---------------

I developed this Shell because I wanted to learn more about Python, and it's really cool!

Since I made the first version, I never stopped developing. I can't develop it alone so I decided to make it Open Source so every Developer who likes the Idea can help improve it.





Commands
---------------

Right now, there are not that much commands.

But I'm working on it! And maybe the Open 
Source Community can help me!
