How it started


I developed this Shell because I wanted to learn more about Python, and it's really cool!

Since I made the first version, I never stopped developing. I can't develop it alone so I decided to make it Open Source so every Developer who likes the Idea can help improve it.





Commands

Right now, there are not that much commands.
But I'm working on it! And maybe the Open 
Source Community can help me!
